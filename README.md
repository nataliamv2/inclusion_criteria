# inclusion_criteria
Calcium imaging studies require the use of inclusion criteria to identify responsive neurons to assure that they code effectively for the stimuli that are used. Five recent studies used calcium imaging to measure the preferred tuning properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual areas. These five studies employed different inclusion criteria and report different, sometimes conflicting results. Here, we examine how different inclusion criteria can impact reported tuning properties, modifying inclusion criteria to select different sub-populations from the same dataset of almost 10,000 layer 2/3 neurons from the Allen Brain Observatory. This code applies different inclusion criteria used in the literature to the Allen Institute Brain Observatory.
